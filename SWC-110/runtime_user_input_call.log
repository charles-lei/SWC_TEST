Function name: check(address)
PC address: 272
Estimated Gas Usage: 1756 - 36506
A reachable exception has been detected.
It is possible to trigger an exception (opcode 0xfe). Exceptions can be caused by type errors, division by zero, out-of-bounds array access, or assert violations. Note that explicit `assert()` should only be used to check invariants. Use `require()` for regular input checking.
